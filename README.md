SDLC Based Learning Activity



This project is about ATM transaction wherein different operations are performed. This ATM machine is connected to the bank network and is controlled by the bank admin.
On inserting the ATM card into the card slot, the machine would prompt the user to enter the registered PIN. If the PIN entered is correct, it would prompt the user to select the type of transaction else it would prompt the user to re-enter the correct PIN two more times. If the last attempt fails, the card will be blocked for 24 hours.
